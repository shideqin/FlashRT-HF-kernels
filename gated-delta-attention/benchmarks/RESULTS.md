# Results

## SM120 MMA WY KKT

RTX 5090, PyTorch `2.11.0+cu128`, 10 warmup and 100 measured launches:

| S | Scalar KKT | MMA KKT | Speedup |
| ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 2048 | 876.26 us | 26.65 us | 32.88x |

Both rows use the same tensors, output layout, stream, and package source
extension. See `VALIDATION.md` for the five-length numerical and graph gate.

Built-artifact benchmark results are pending for v5.

## Speculative state stash

RTX 5090, PyTorch `2.11.0+cu128`, preallocated buffers:

| Shape | One stash scan | Four prefix re-advances | Speedup | Correctness |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| S=8, Hv/Hk/D=32/16/128 | 58.02 us | 119.89 us | 2.07x | bit-exact |

Every stash row used by the rollback gate equals the corresponding plain-core
prefix state bit for bit; CUDA Graph replay is also bit-identical.

## H32/H16 WY prefill

RTX 5090 source-extension triage, PyTorch `2.9.1+cu128`. Both rows use the
same seven native WY stages, static workspaces, fixed-order reductions, and
the same state-reset copy. H48 is the package's established native entry;
H32 uses the new parameterized entry.

| S | H32 WY us | H48 native WY us | H32 / H48 |
| ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 64 | 106.120 | 122.928 | 0.863 |
| 65 | 112.477 | 131.137 | 0.858 |
| 128 | 145.583 | 174.526 | 0.834 |
| 256 | 215.260 | 281.859 | 0.764 |

The prior serial 64x64 triangular solve took 2.18-2.43 ms by itself. Version
5 replaces it with a 64-thread shared-memory fixed-order solve; the complete
H32 pipeline is 20.6x faster at S=64 while preserving the reference metrics.

## Generic H32/H16 fused producer + chunk

Local source-extension benchmark on RTX 5090, PyTorch `2.9.1+cu128`. Both
paths reset the same BF16 recurrent state. `staged native` invokes the same
package's native split, gating, and shared-memory chunk kernels separately;
the fused path reads `conv_out/a/b` directly. Correctness is bit-identical.

| S | Fused native us | Staged native us | Speedup | Exact |
| ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| 1 | 12.293 | 17.288 | 1.41x | yes |
| 4 | 28.666 | 32.777 | 1.14x | yes |
| 64 | 362.683 | 366.435 | 1.01x | yes |

The fused chunk computes each per-token/head gate scalar once in thread 0 and
broadcasts it through shared memory; all 128 lanes no longer repeat the same
transcendentals. Regenerate these rows from the v5 built artifact before
making artifact-level performance claims.

## Full recurrent sequence entry

Source-extension benchmark on RTX 5090, PyTorch 2.9.1+cu128.

| Shape | Eager us | Compile us | Legacy per-token native us | Wrapper us | Raw sequence us |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| `S65 H4 D128` | 7795.950 | 2092.266 | 798.974 | 306.614 | 305.986 |

The one-launch sequence entry is 6.82x faster than compile and 2.61x faster
than the prior per-token native launch loop. Wrapper overhead is 0.21%.
