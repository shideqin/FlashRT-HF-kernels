# Validation

Required source gate before publishing:

```bash
python gated-delta-attention/tests/test_gated_delta_attention.py --backend source --mode full
```

Correctness metrics:

- `max_abs`
- `mean_abs`
- `p99_abs`
- cosine similarity

## SM120 MMA WY KKT

The additive `gdn_wy_kkt_b64_mma_bf16` source gate covers
`S={63,64,657,2048,2049}` against the established scalar entry. Across the
grid, max absolute error was at most `3.73e-8`, p99 relative error was at most
`3.20e-6`, and every upper-triangular and out-of-range tail value was exactly
zero. Two CUDA Graph replays were bit-identical.

At S=2048 on RTX 5090, PyTorch `2.11.0+cu128`, the scalar entry measured
`876.26 us` and the MMA entry `26.65 us`, a `32.88x` speedup. This comparison
uses the same package, tensors, stream, output layout, warmup, and timing
harness.

The reference uses the same recurrent Gated DeltaNet math with FP32 internal
accumulation and BF16 state/output casts. Split/gating helpers are checked
against exact PyTorch tensor formulas. `gdn_chunk_from_conv_smem_bf16` and the
WY pipeline are checked end-to-end against the same recurrent reference.

## Speculative state stash

The H32/H16 stash gate uses `S=8` and requires bit-exact equality against the
plain native fused chunk for the full output and final in-place state. Stash
rows `0,2,4,6,7` are independently compared with plain-kernel re-advances over
prefix lengths `1,3,5,7,8`; every comparison is bit-exact. An undersized stash
is rejected, and two CUDA Graph replays are bit-identical for output, final
state, and the complete stash.

On RTX 5090 with PyTorch `2.11.0+cu128`, the stash entry measured `58.02 us`
at `S/Hv/Hk/D=8/32/16/128`. Four separate prefix re-advances measured
`119.89 us`, so state selection replaces that work at `2.07x` lower latency.

The v5 H32/H16 producer profile covers `S={1,4,64}`. The complete H32 WY
profile covers `S={1,17,64,65,128,256}` and all 11 head-parameterized stages.
It additionally requires:

- exact split parity;
- ordinary and strided gating parity with FP32 gate parameters;
- fused chunk output and in-place state exact parity with the same package's
  staged native split + gating + shared-memory chunk path;
- independent PyTorch recurrent-reference metrics;
- two CUDA Graph replays with bit-identical output and state;
- fail-fast rejection for BF16 gate parameters, wrong conv width, and a
  non-integral `Hv/Hk` broadcast ratio.
- fixed-order parallel triangular solve parity with the former serial solve;
- complete WY CUDA Graph replay with bit-identical output and in-place state.
- deterministic rejection of poisoned packed-Q/value tail data on partial
  64-token tiles;
- installed-wrapper parity under `torch.compile(fullgraph=True)`.
- twenty repeated single-chunk H32 WY launches. This is a regression gate for
  the `NT=1` asynchronous-copy boundary and must not be replaced by a relaxed
  numerical tolerance.

`gated_delta_recurrent_sequence_bf16` keeps recurrent state in FP32 for the
entire sequence and casts state to BF16 only once on exit. Its independent
reference therefore does the same; comparing it to the legacy per-token BF16
state-rounding loop is not an equivalent numerical contract. Sequence rows
cover `S={1,17,63,64,65,127,128,129,256,512}` and `H={4,48}`.

## Generated Artifact Smoke

Local generated pyproject wheel path:

```bash
DEBUG=0 MAX_JOBS=8 NVCC_THREADS=2 TORCH_CUDA_ARCH_LIST=12.0a \
  python -m pip wheel . -w /tmp/gated-delta-wheel -v --no-build-isolation

python tests/test_gated_delta_attention.py \
  --backend installed \
  --artifact build/lib.linux-x86_64-cpython-313 \
  --mode full \
  --json-out ../internal-tests/gated-delta-attention-installed-local-full.json
```

Result: same full rows, CUDA Graph, poisoned-tail regression, and
`torch.compile(fullgraph=True)` checks pass for the local generated artifact.

For v5 release artifacts, rerun the same command against the HF Jobs artifact
before updating the installed-artifact claim.

## SM110 Source Results

Jetson AGX Thor source validation passes `38/38`, including the complete H32
WY chain at `S={1,17,64,65,128,256}`, CUDA Graph bitwise replay, poisoned-tail
rejection, and the 20-repeat `S=64` single-chunk stress gate. RTX 5090 source
validation passes the same `38/38` matrix.

The stress gate exposed an actual `cp.async wait_group` race for the one-chunk
case. The implementation now waits for the only committed group when `NT=1`;
multi-chunk execution retains the pipelined wait. Release artifacts must pass
the same installed test matrix on both torch 2.11 and torch 2.13.
