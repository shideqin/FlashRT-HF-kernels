# Validation

Local source validation covers NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090 (SM120) and NVIDIA
Jetson AGX Thor (SM110).

## SM120 Decode/Prefill Tiers

RTX 5090, PyTorch `2.11.0+cu128`, CUDA source extension built against CUTLASS
4.5.0:

- full package source gate: `30/30`;
- interleaved weight repack: exact against the host byte permutation on six
  production N/K pairs;
- interleaved GEMV: `18/18` outputs bit-exact against the existing warp-split
  kernel across warps 2/4/8;
- M256: bit-exact against the existing 128-tile GEMM at `(512,1024,1024)`;
- M=511 is rejected before launch;
- two M256 CUDA Graph replays are bit-identical with caller-owned workspace.
- multi-row warp-split GEMM: `24/24` production rows are bit-identical to
  independently quantized per-row warp-split GEMV (`M={2,4,7,8}` over six
  Qwen3.8 N/K pairs);
- M=17 is rejected before launch and two multi-row CUDA Graph replays are
  bit-identical.

The interleaved GEMV measured `1529.8 GB/s` on a `574.6 MiB` cyclic working
set at `(N,K)=(17408,5120)`, 8 warps and 3 stages, versus `1.096x` slower base
GEMV. The M256/128-tile speedups at M=2044 were `1.097x`, `1.167x`, and
`1.099x` for `(N,K)=(17408,5120),(5120,17408),(12288,5120)`. The
`(16384,5120)` row measured `0.986x` in alternating min-of-N runs and is
therefore diagnostic, not production-qualified.

At `(M,N,K)=(8,17408,5120)`, the standard-layout multi-row entry measured
`42.24 us` median versus `234.86 us` for eight independent warp-split GEMV
launches, a `5.56x` speedup. Both paths consumed the same packed tensors and
used the same warp/stage configuration.

```bash
python fp4-gemm/tests/test_fp4_gemm.py \
  --backend source \
  --mode full \
  --json-out internal-tests/fp4-gemm-source-full.json
```

Result:

- SM120 full gate: `25/25` checks passed, including all fused epilogues and
  the aggregate BF16 direct-producer layout gate.
- SM110 model-shape gate: `24/24` checks passed across PI0.5, GROOT, Cosmos
  Edge, and LingBot VLA projection shapes.
- Variants `0`, `1`, and `2` were checked.
- SM110 additionally checks production auto-dispatch (`variant=-1`).
- `nvfp4_gemm_bf16` is the canonical public API.
- Correctness reference dequantizes the same FP4/SFA and FP4/SFB inputs used
  by the kernel, then computes PyTorch GEMM on those dequantized values.
- The direct BF16 producer is byte-exact against the established
  BF16-to-FP16 plus FP16-producer contract for packed E2M1, mapped SFA/SFB
  bytes, and dequantized output. Covered activation shapes are `(1,5120)`,
  `(1,6144)`, `(1,17408)`, `(16,2048)`, and `(128,512)`; SFB coverage uses
  `(64,1024)`.

| Shape | Variant | Max abs | Mean abs | P99 abs | Cosine |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| M=16, N=128, K=128 | 0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 1.0 |
| M=16, N=128, K=128 | 1 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 1.0 |

## Installed Artifact Validation

The local kernel-builder release candidate produced and passed ABI, manylinux,
layout, and builder `get_kernel` checks for:

- `torch211-cxx11-cu128-x86_64-linux`
- `torch211-cxx11-cu130-x86_64-linux`
- `torch212-cxx11-cu130-x86_64-linux`
- `torch212-cxx11-cu132-x86_64-linux`

The cu128/Torch 2.11 artifact passed `10/10` runtime gates: all nine
shape/variant correctness rows were exact against the staged reference, and
the public `nvfp4_gemm_bf16` wrapper was exact under
`torch.compile(fullgraph=True)`.

The SM110 release flake pins kernel-builder commit
`d720fa90fb9cd92d1bc60a9dc5c55bef2aafabb8`, which includes CUTLASS 4.5
support and the corrected CUTLASS 4.5.2 fixed-output hash. HF Jobs, the
SM110 aarch64 artifact build, and cold Hub loads must pass before the rebuilt
Hub release is considered complete.

## SM110 BF16 Bias Epilogue Tile Gate

The release candidate selects between `128x128x128` and `128x128x256` MMA
tiles inside the existing public APIs; no tuning-only symbols are exported.
An exhaustive six-candidate internal sweep covered GROOT `M=41/51` up/down and
VLA `M=105` shapes. All 72 candidate rows were exact against the former stable
tile. The final public dispatch then passed the expanded Thor model gate:
`54/54`, including PI0.5, GROOT, Cosmos Edge, and LingBot shapes.

For BF16 bias and residual outputs, max/mean/p99 error was zero. The FP4 GELU
output uses the package's established quantized-output contract; on GROOT
`M=41` rows cosine was `0.999403-0.999437` with p99 absolute error
`0.1875-0.375`. Final timings are recorded in `benchmarks/RESULTS.md`.

## BF16 Direct Producer

RTX 5090, 100 warmup iterations and 1000 measured iterations:

| Shape | BF16 direct | BF16 cast + FP16 producer | Speedup | Native BF16 producer | Hub/native |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| M=1, K=5120 | 4.098 us | 6.404 us | 1.563x | 6.150 us | 0.666x |
| M=1, K=6144 | 4.098 us | 6.403 us | 1.562x | 8.190 us | 0.500x |
| M=1, K=17408 | 4.096 us | 6.413 us | 1.566x | 18.442 us | 0.222x |

The native BF16 producer is included as a latency comparison but uses a
different FlashRT quantization strategy. Correctness acceptance is therefore
against this package's established FP16 producer contract, where all tested
packed and mapped scale bytes are exact.

## SM120 public bias increment

On 2026-08-11, RTX 5090 source validation passed `29/29`, including public
`nvfp4_gemm_bias_bf16` rows at `(64,512,512)`, `(360,14336,3072)`, and
`(360,3072,14336)`. The public entry was bitwise equal to the established SM120
Stream-K bias launcher and measured within `1.0002x` on the small row and no
slower on either model-scale row. Installed-artifact validation is still
required after the x86 rebuild.

## Thor Native Parity

The Tensor wrapper was compared against the same native FlashRT launchers on
Thor with 20 warmup and 100 measured iterations. For production auto-dispatch
across the six model shapes, wrapper/native latency ratio had median `1.019`
and maximum `1.086`. Correctness was exact (`max_abs=mean_abs=p99_abs=0`).

## SM110 additive format and epilogue gate

On 2026-08-06, the current source snapshot passed `18/18` smoke checks on
NVIDIA Thor, PyTorch `2.13.0+cu130`, and CUDA 13.0. The independent E0M3
sign-magnitude/SFA reference produced exact output for
`e0m3_weight_gemm_fp16` at `(M,N,K)=(64,512,512)`. The Cosmos Edge
`nvfp4_gemm_relu2_nvfp4` row had p99 absolute error `0`, cosine
`0.99996096`, deterministic packed/scale output, and bitwise CUDA Graph
replay. `a_format=0` denotes E0M3 activations; `a_format=1` denotes the default
NVFP4 activation path with E0M3 weights.
